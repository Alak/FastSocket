Fast Socket
===============

Description
---------------

A very fast, synchronous Objective-C wrapper around BSD sockets. Allows you to send
and receive raw bytes over a socket very quickly. Includes methods for transferring
files while optionally computing a checksum for verification.

This is the class to use if fast network communication is what you need. An
asynchronous API might be better if you want to do something else while your network
operations finish.
